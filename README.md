## Technologies Used  

The **To-Do List App** was created using React via Microsoft Visual Studio Code. The coding language of preference to create this app was JavaScript. Our data is stored in MongoDB.  

## Getting Started  

For use of this app, feel free to clone it yourself using my [repo link](https://github.com/SWEJoseAneurys/ToDoListApp.git). With this link, you’ll be able to use my development as a template to create your own app and design it in ways that work best for you! Otherwise, feel free to utilize the live app as is today!
